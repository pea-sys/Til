## title: Evidence uses Markdown

Markdown can be used to write expressively in text.

- it supports lists,
- **bolding**, _italics_ and `inline code`,
- links to [external sites](https://google.com) and other [Evidence pages](/another/page)

## Images üñºÔ∏è

Evidence looks for images in your `static` folder, e.g. `static/my-logo.png`.
![Company Logo](/my-logo.png)

# Syntax

```sql orders_by_month
select
    date_trunc('month', order_datetime) as order_month,
    count(*) as number_of_orders,
    sum(sales) as sales_usd
from needful_things.orders
group by 1, order by 1 desc
```

# Component

<LineChart 
    data = {orders_by_month}    
    y = sales_usd 
    title = 'Sales by Month, USD' 
/>

# Loop

{#each orders_by_month as month}

- There were <Value data={month} column=number_of_orders/> orders in <Value data={month} />.

{/each}

# If / Else

{#if orders_by_month && orders_by_month.length > 1}
{#if orders_by_month[0].sales_usd > orders_by_month[1].sales_usd}

Sales are up month-over-month.

{:else}

Sales are down vs last month. See [category detail](/sales-by-category).

{/if}
{:else}

  <div>No sufficient data available to perform the comparison.</div>
{/if}
